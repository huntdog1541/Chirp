Chirp is a modern low-level programming language written in C++. Currently the language is still very early and can barely run yet, but I am actively working on the compiler, and hope one day it will be a functioning language.

## Simple Example

```chirp
  entry ()
  {
    # Assign 123 to the variable "a", which is an int
    int: a = 123
  }
```

## Building

We are using CMake, so building is very easy. Depending on your platform there might be scripts to run the CMake commands for you, but even without the scripts it's very easy.

### Dependencies

- any compiler that supports c++11
- `cmake` 3.8.2 or higher

### Linux

You can build using the `build.sh` script

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/chirp-language/Chirp.git
  cd Chirp
  sh build.sh
```

The executable will be created in `./build/src/Chirp`.

### Windows

There's no scripts for windows, but you can use the CMake gui.

## Features

We are rewritting the compiler, and this is what we have done so far:

- [x] Variable declaration `24-07-2019`
- [x] Variable definition `25-07-2019`
- [x] Math ``25-07-2019``
- [x] Functions ``26-07-2019``
- [x] Function calls ``27-07-2019``
- [x] Inline assembly ``28-07-2019``
- [ ] If statements
- [ ] Else statements
- [ ] While statements
- [ ] For statements
- [ ] Imports
- [ ] Pointers
- [ ] Macros
- [ ] Dynamic memory allocation
- [ ] IO library
- [ ] Math library
- [ ] Eve library
